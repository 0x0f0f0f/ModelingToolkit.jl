These methods can be derived solving a system of nonlinear equations for its coefficients. To achieve this, we usually admit various simplifying assumptions. The most common of them are the so-called row simplifying assumptions. Here we neglect them and present an algorithm for the construction of Runge–Kutta pairs of orders 5 and 4 based only in the first column simplifying assumption. The result is a pair that outperforms other known pairs in the bibliography when tested to the standard set of problems of DETEST. A cost free fourth order formula is also derived for handling dense output.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04344},
	abstract = {Stochastic diﬀerential equations (SDE) often exhibit large random transitions. This property, which we denote as pathwise stiﬀness, causes transient bursts of stiﬀness which limit the allowed step size for common ﬁxed time step explicit and drift-implicit integrators. We present four separate methods to eﬃciently handle this stiﬀness. First, we utilize a computational technique to derive stability-optimized adaptive methods of strong order 1.5 for SDEs. The resulting explicit methods are shown to exhibit substantially enlarged stability regions which allows for them to solve pathwise stiﬀ biological models orders of magnitude more eﬃciently than previous methods like SRIW1 and Euler-Maruyama. Secondly, these integrators include a stiﬀness estimator which allows for automatically switching between implicit and explicit schemes based on the current stiﬀness. In addition, adaptive L-stable strong order 1.5 implicit integrators for SDEs and stochastic diﬀerential algebraic equations (SDAEs) in mass-matrix form with additive noise are derived and are demonstrated as more eﬃcient than the explicit methods on stiﬀ chemical reaction networks by nearly 8x. Lastly, we developed an adaptive implicit-explicit (IMEX) integration method based oﬀ of a common method for diﬀusion-reaction-convection PDEs and show numerically that it can achieve strong order 1.5. These methods are benchmarked on a range of problems varying from non-stiﬀ to extreme pathwise stiﬀ and demonstrate speedups between 5x-6000x while showing computationally infeasibility of ﬁxed time step integrators on many of these test equations.},

	abstract = {A new language called Modelica for physical modeling is developed in an international effort. The main purpose is to make it easy to exchange models and model libraries. The design approach builds on non-casual modeling with true equations and the use of object-oriented constructs to facilitate reuse of modeling knowledge. There are already several modeling language based on these ideas available from universities and small companies. There is also significant experience of using them in various applications. The aim of the Modelica effort is to unify the concepts and design a new uniform model language for model representation. The paper describes the effort and gives an overview of Modelica.},
